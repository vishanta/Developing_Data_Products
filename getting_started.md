**Welcome to my Shiny App!**

### Overview
**Best Car for a Trip in MTCARS** is a part of the Coursera Assignment for "Developing Data Products" module. It consists of two parts. First, a Shiny application is created and deployed on Rstudio's servers. Second, Slidify or RStudio Presenter is used to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application developed in part one. This Shiny App refers to the first part of the assignment.

### Shiny App Workflow
This Shiny application helps to choose a best car for a trip by using the MTCARS dataset. The basic workflow is as follows:

- There are various input parameters that affect the result on the right pane of the Shiny app.
- Input distance of a trip, price of gasoline and several other parameters which will compute to find the cars matching the selected criteria.
- Output table intuitive and dynamic, letting users perform filter, sort, search and navigate the cars.
